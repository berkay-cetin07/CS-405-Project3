# CS 405 Project 3: Scene Graph + Illumination Implementation Report

## Objective

The goal of the project was to implement and enhance a scene graph to simulate a solar system using WebGL. This involved:

1.Establishing hierarchical transformations (Task 1).

2.Implementing realistic illumination with diffuse and specular lighting (Task 2).

3.Adding Mars as a new object to the solar system and ensuring it functions correctly in the scene graph (Task 3).
